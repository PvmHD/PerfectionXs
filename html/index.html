					<h1>Server Info</h1>
					<br>
					<p>The reason why we have decided to release PerfectionX is that we have grown tired on working hard, and we had all of the fun from this server that there possibly was to of been had, it has been a great learning experience, and now it is time to give back to the community so other people can have as much fun playing the server as we did.
